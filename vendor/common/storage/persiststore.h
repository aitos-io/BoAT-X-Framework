 *   Fields Explanation
 *   
 *   \n <b>[SALT]</b>
 *   The beginning of the file is a 16-byte random salt field. The salt is used as
 *   the Initial Vector (IV) of the AES256_CBC encryption algorithm. The randomness
 *   of the IV is a security factor. With identical IV, identical plain text
 *   always generates identical encrypted text against identical crypto key. Thus
 *   in turn the attacker may infer some information of the plain text from the
 *   encrypted text. Random IV generates different encrypted text even if the
 *   plain text is identical.
 *
 *   \n <b>[HASH]</b>
 *   The second field is a 32-byte keccak256 hash (the same keccak256 as the one
 *   used by Ethereum). To verify the data in decryption phase, the hash of the
 *   plain data is saved in the file. If any of the encrypted data, IV or the AES
 *   key is corrupted, the hash of the decrypted data definitely diffs from the
 *   original one.
 *
 *   \n <b>[AES256 ENCRYPTED DATA]</b>
 *   The third field is the encrypted data by AES-256 CBC.
 *   \n AES is a block cipher algorithm with a block size of 16 bytes. To encrypt
 *   plain text of any size, some block cipher mode of operation is performed.
 *   AES-CBC is one of the most popular modes. It XORs every plain text block
 *   with the previous encrypted text block and encrypts the XORed block. For
 *   the first plain text block, an extra 16-byte Initial Vector (IV) is XORed.
 *   \n To decrypt an encrypted block, first decrypt the block with the same AES
 *   key and then XOR the decrypted text with the encrypted text of the previous
 *   block. This recovers the plain text block.
 *   \n To decrypt the first encrypted block (whose corresponding plain text block
 *   was XORed with IV before being encrypted), the same IV as the one at
 *   encryption time must be specified.
 *
 *   \n <b>[PKCS PADDING]</b>
 *
 *   The fourth field is padding as per OpenSSL rules.
 *   
 *   \n OpenSSL uses PKCS#7 padding rule for AES by default. As AES's block size is
 *   16 bytes, the rule adds 1-to-16-byte padding with every byte's value equal
 *   to how many bytes the padding is. For example, if 6 bytes are added as
 *   padding, the value of every byte is 0x06. Especally if no padding is required,
 *   this rule always adds a 16-byte padding. When decrypting, OpenSSL will check
 *   the padding value against PKCS#7 rule as a simple validition and automatically
 *   removes PKCS#7 padding by default.
 *   \n Besides the PKCS#7 padding, there is an extra 0-to-15-byte padding for data
 *   alignment.
 *   \n Thus the total padding size varies between 1~31 bytes. The output buffer
 *   must have enough room to hold the encrypted data.
 *
 * @param[in] storage_name_str
 *   The file name to store the data.
 *
 * @param[in] data_ptr
 *   The plain data to save into file.
 *
 * @param[in] data_len
 *   Length (in byte) of <data_ptr>.\n
 *   If <data_len> is 0, no file will be created.
 *
 * @return
 *   This function returns BOAT_SUCCESS if it successfully stores the data.\n
 *   Otherwise it returns one of the error codes.
