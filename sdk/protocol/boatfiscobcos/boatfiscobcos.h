 * @brief Construct a raw FISCOBCOS transacton and encodes it as per RLP rules.
 *
 * @details
 *   This function constructs a raw transacton and sends it asynchronously (i.e.
 *   don't wait for it being mined).
    
 *   \n AN INTRODUCTION OF HOW RAW TRANSACTION IS CONSTRUCTED
 *   
 *   <b>[FIELDS IN A RAW TRANSACTION]</b>
 *   A RAW transaction consists of following 10 fields:
 *       1. nonce;
 *       2. gasprice;
 *       3. gaslimit;
 *       4. blocklimit(transaction life cycle);
 *       5. recipient;
 *       6. value(currently not used in de-coinized FISCO BCOS);
 *       7. data;
 *       8. chainid(record the chain/business information to which the transaction belongs);
 *       9. groupid(group to which this transaction belongs);
 *      10. extraData(reserved segment);
 *      11. v;
 *      12. signature.r;
 *      13. signature.s;
 *
 *   These transaction fields are encoded as elements of a LIST in above order
 *   as per RLP encoding rules. "LIST" is a type of RLP field.
 *
 *   EXCEPTION:
 *   For Ethereum any fields (except <recipient>) having a value of zero are
 *   treated as NULL stream in RLP encoding instead of 1-byte-size stream whose
 *   value is 0. For example, nonce = 0 is encoded as 0x80 which represents NULL
 *   instead of 0x00 which represents a 1-byte-size stream whose value is 0.
 *
 *   <b>[HOW TO CONSTRUCT A RAW TRANSACTION]</b>
 *   A RAW transaction is constructed in 4 steps in different ways according to
 *   Specifies the blockchain ID. 
 *
 *   See following article for details about EIP-155: 
 *   https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md
 *
 *   <I>CASE 1: If the data encoding is not specifying the chain ID:</I>
 *   
 *       \n - Step 1: Encode a LIST containing only the first 7 fields.
 *       \n - Step 2: Calculate SHA3 hash of the encoded stream in Step 1.
 *       \n - Step 3: Sign the hash in Step 2. This generates r, s and parity (0 or 1) for recovery identifier.
 *       \n - Step 4: Encode a LIST containing all 10 fields, where
 *               First 7 fields are same as what they are;
 *               v = parity + 27, where parity is given in Step 3;
 *               r and s are given in Step 3.
 *
 *   <I>CASE 2: If the data encoding is specifying the chain ID:</I>
 *       \n - Step 1: Encode all 10 fields (a LIST containing all 10 fields), where
 *               First 7 fields are same as what they are;
 *               v = Chain ID;
 *               r = 0;
 *               s = 0;
 *               NOTE: zero value fields other than <recipient> are encoded as NULL stream.
 *       \n - Step 2: Same as CASE 1.
 *       \n - Step 3: Same as CASE 1.
 *       \n - Step 4: Encode a LIST containing all 10 fields, where
 *               First 7 fields are same as what they are;
 *               v = Chain ID * 2 + parity + 35, where parity is given in Step 3;
 *               r and s are given in Step 3.
 * 
 * @param[in] tx_ptr
 *       A pointer to the context of the transaction.
 * 
 * @return
 *   This function returns BOAT_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns one\n
 *   of the error codes.
