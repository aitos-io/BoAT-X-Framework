## Introduction
Welcome to the official implementation of BoAT Framework! 

**BoAT** blockchain application framework is an IoT-device-oriented lightweight blockchain client SDK written in C language. **BoAT** stands for *Blockchain of AI Things* and also depicts the vision that a boat transfers trustworthy information from the data source through to the data lake.


### The Pain Point

Most blockchain or BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) variants bring with either node or client/wallet software. However these softwares are basically designed for personal computer, cloud server or smart phone and usually written in high-level languages such as Go, Java, JavaScript, Python etc. Some of them require cumbersome virtual machine or interpreter to execute and some even have to download code dynamically at runtime. Meanwhile IoT devices are not as powerful and typically run RTOS or lightweight linux. Due to constrained resources, most IoT devices could only support native C language applications and thus can hardly access blockchain directly.


### The Solution

There are basically two methods to resolve the problem. One is, the IoT devices send data to a traditional centralized cloud server which is the data hub and then the hub relays the data to blockchain. This method resolves the problem with some trade-off of higher single point failure probability at the data hub.

The other method is, the IoT devices directly invoke on-chain smart contract via a blockchain client that meets the device environment and the blockchain. This method allows every IoT device to access blockchain in an independent and distributed way with the trade-off that a C-language blockchain client SDK has to be developed and ported to various device hardware and software environments.

The latter is the way **BoAT** is walking on. To ease off the effort that IoT device manufacturers have to take, *aitos.io* initiates and contributes to **BoAT**, the C-language blockchain application framework, enabling IoT device to easily access the blockchain. 


### Supported Blockchain

This version supports:
+ Ethereum
+ PlatON Enterprise (PlatONE)

More blockchains are to be supported.


### Release
For full list of new features, please read [aitos.io Release Notes](https://github.com/aitos-io/BoAT-X-Framework/releases).


## Quick Start

### Dependencies 

BoAT is tested with following dependencies. The dependent softwares with lower version probably work well but are not tested.

#### General
In general, following dependencies are required:

Dependencies    | Requirements
----------------|:------------:
Host OS         |Depending on the development tool chain of the underlying device
Make            |GNU Make (4.3 is tested)
Python          |3.8.3 (Python 2.7 is also compatible)


#### For Cygwin64 or linux_x86_64
To build BoAT for demo purpose on a personal computer, following additional dependencies are required:

Dependencies    | Requirements
----------------|:------------:
gcc             |4.9.2 is tested
libcurl         |7.55.1 is tested
openssl         |1.1.1d is tested


#### For embedded device
For embedded device, the exact configuration depends on the development tool chain of the underlying device.

Among them, linux-based embedded devices are basically similar to that on x86_64, except for the exact compiler and dependent library version may be device-specific. Meanwhile RTOS-based embedded devices are much diverse.


### Before building the demo
As BoAT is a client for blockchain, some environment must be prepared before build the demo.

#### Make use of a deployed blockchain or deploy your own blockchain
For public blockchain, you must prepare some gas for transaction fee in advance. If a simulator is available for that blockchain, it's a better choice.

For consortium blockchain , you must consult the administrator to give you access permission on the blockchain. Or you may deploy your own consortium blockchain node for test purpose.

See blockchain official website for details:
For [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)
For [Ganache: an Ethereum Simulator](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle/)
For [PlatON Enterprise](https://github.com/PlatONEnterprise/)

#### Deploy the smart contract
The smart contracts used in the demo locate in ./contract.
Follow blockchain official website for details on how to compile and deploy the contract.

#### Modify the demo code
Modify the demo code in ./demo:
+ Replace the private key and account address (if necessary) with a appropriate one
+ Replace the smart contract address with the one you got when deploying the contract
+ Replace the URL of the blockchain node with the real one

```

#### To build BoAT demo application
```
$make demo
```
The built demo application locates at:
./build/demo/boatdemo


#### To build BoAT libraries only
```
$make boatlibs
```
The built libraries locate at:
./lib/libboatwallet.a
./lib/libboathwdep.a


#### To clean everything
```
$make clean
```



### Run BoAT demo on x86_64
If BoAT is built for Cygwin or linux-x86_64, run the demo application:
real node of an Ethereum compatible blockchain network must be available.
```
$chmod a+x ./build/demo/boatdemo
$./build/demo/boatdemo
```

Make sure the network connection to the blockchain node (or blockchain simulator) is available.



## Using BoAT in Your Code

### Contract C Interface Generation

Smart contract is the code running on the blockchain virtual machine. Smart contract runs like remote API calls. Though the programming language of smart contract is not C, it has defined ABI (Application Binary Interface). Remote call to the contract must follow the ABI.

However manually applying the rule of ABI is quite complex for embedded C programmers. BoAT IoT Framework SDK provides some tools to generate C interface codes from the ABI. The generated C API can be called from other part within the C project. Though not all contract ABI can be converted to C interface due to lack of object-oriented programming capability, the tools could ease a lot of works.

The generation tools are written in Python and lie in ./tools.

Copy the ABI json file generated by truffle or ctool during contract compilation, to the corresponding directory in ./contract. The generation tool will be called against the ABI file during make. You can include generated head files (./contract/generated) in your C code to call the APIs.



### How to Call a Contract in Your C code

1. Call BoatWalletCreate() with appropriate configuration to create a wallet. The private key in the configuration must follow the actual key in your control. You can also generate a private key by calling BoatXXWalletGeneratePrivkey() if you know what you’re doing.

2. Call BoatXXTxInit() with the wallet reference and other parameters to initialize a transaction object (even if it’s a state-less call), where XX is the blockchain protocol name.

3. Call generated C interface API with the initialized transaction object and other arguments.

4. Check the return value of the C interface API. If it’s not NULL, parse the string content as per contract prototype.

See demo code for reference.

To manually organize a contract call, refer to the generated C API codes. Note that the interface definition is different for different blockchain protocols.


### Configure Your Makefile and C code

To use BoAT in your own code, please following these steps.

#### Build BoAT libraries
Place BoAT source somewhere in your project and build BoAT libraries.

#### Generate C interface code
Generate C interface code from contract ABI and add the generated C files into project for building.
See [*Contract C Interface Generation*](#contract-c-interface-generation) for how to generate them.

#### Modify Makefile of your project
Add include file search path:
+   \<SDKRoot\>/include
+   Path to generated C interface header file
    
Add to link options all library files in <SDKRoot>/lib in sequence:
+   libboatwallet.a
+   libboathwdep.a

Add to link options: -lcurl -lcrypto


#### Modify your C code
Add: #include “boatiotsdk.h”
Follow instructions in [*How to Call a Contract in Your C code*](#how-to-call-a-contract-in-your-c-code).
